    <div class="container">

      <h2 class="section-title">1) Understand your budget and eligibility first</h2>
      <p>
        Start by evaluating your financial readiness. In Singapore, you can estimate affordability using the <strong>Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR)</strong>, which caps loan repayments to 55% of your gross monthly income. Next, check your CPF Ordinary Account (OA) balance and cash savings. Together, these will determine your entry point. Even with limited funds, understanding these numbers gives you a realistic starting position.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">2) Begin with smaller private units or compact condos</h2>
      <p>
        Studio and one-bedroom condos are often priced lower per quantum, making them ideal for first-time investors. They also enjoy stronger rental demand among singles, expatriates, and young professionals. Look for projects that combine efficient layouts with good transport access—like those featured in the <strong>Narra Residences Showflat</strong>—to ensure your small unit attracts consistent tenants.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">3) Explore executive condominiums (ECs) for hybrid value</h2>
      <p>
        Executive Condominiums bridge public and private housing. They’re priced lower at launch but appreciate after the <strong>5-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP)</strong>. After 10 years, ECs become fully privatized, opening resale opportunities to foreigners. This dual-phase growth makes them a strong low-budget entry strategy for Singaporeans and PRs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">4) Maximize leverage smartly—don’t overborrow</h2>
      <p>
        Financing is a powerful tool when used wisely. Under the TDSR framework, you can borrow up to 75% loan-to-value (LTV) for your first property. However, always leave headroom for emergencies or rate fluctuations. Using a mix of CPF and cash helps balance liquidity. Avoid stretching loans to the limit; sustainable leverage compounds wealth more safely than risky bets.
      </p>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>Financing checklist</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a good credit score to secure lower interest rates.</li>
          <li>Use your CPF OA strategically for down payments.</li>
          <li>Compare bank packages (fixed vs floating) for long-term savings.</li>
          <li>Keep an emergency fund equal to 6–12 months of instalments.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="section-title">5) Co-ownership and fractional property investing</h2>
      <p>
        If direct purchase seems out of reach, explore joint ownership with family members or trusted partners. Fractional investment platforms are also emerging, allowing smaller investors to own shares of larger assets. While due diligence is essential, these models reduce entry barriers and diversify exposure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">6) Consider resale condos with renovation potential</h2>
      <p>
        Older resale units often trade below new launch prices. A well-chosen resale with good bones can outperform newer projects if upgraded thoughtfully. Focus on location, structural soundness, and layout potential. Compact units with functional space and proximity to MRT stations or business hubs tend to hold demand better.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">7) Prioritize high-yield rental districts</h2>
      <p>
        Rental yield is your friend when investing with limited funds. Study districts like Geylang, Balestier, Woodlands, and Queenstown, which offer relatively high yields at lower quantum. Calculate net rental yield by subtracting maintenance, property tax, and agent fees from annual rent, then dividing by the purchase price. Aim for 3–4% or higher for stability.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">8) Tap government grants or schemes (if eligible)</h2>
      <p>
        Singapore’s housing system offers grants primarily for first-time buyers of HDB or ECs. Even if you plan to upgrade later, leveraging these grants builds equity faster. Once your first property appreciates, you can refinance or sell to fund a condo purchase, stepping up gradually toward private investments.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">9) Focus on location, not just price</h2>
      <p>
        A cheap property in a poor location can drain returns. Prioritize accessibility, future MRT stations, and surrounding amenities. Developments like the <strong>Narra Residences Showflat</strong> exemplify how strong location and efficient design combine to retain long-term value. Location resilience supports both rental demand and resale potential, which are vital when working with limited capital.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">10) Reinvest rental income and build capital discipline</h2>
      <p>
        Treat rental income as seed capital for your next property. Reinvest profits into paying down your loan faster or building reserves for another purchase. Over 5–10 years, disciplined reinvestment amplifies returns and moves you from “low-budget” investor to multi-property owner.
      </p>

      <div class="box success">
        <h3>Example: Small-start strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose you buy a $600,000 one-bedroom condo with $150,000 in cash/CPF and rent it out at $2,800 per month. After expenses, you net around $1,000 monthly. Reinvesting this income and building equity through loan repayment positions you for a second purchase within 5–7 years—proof that starting small works.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="section-title">11) Learn from showflats and market data</h2>
      <p>
        Visiting showflats like <strong>Narra Residences Showflat</strong> helps investors understand space utilization, finishing quality, and layout efficiency. Take note of furnishing standards and how developers maximize small spaces. This insight helps you identify underpriced units in other projects with similar traits.
      </p>

      

      <h2 class="section-title">Final word: small capital, big potential</h2>
      <p>
        Investing with a low budget is about creativity, patience, and informed choices. Start where you can afford, stay disciplined with your financing, and always buy for long-term fundamentals—location, layout, and demand. If a development’s efficiency and connectivity—like those showcased at the <strong>Narra Residences Showflat</strong>—align with your financial goals, you’re already taking the smartest first step toward property growth in Singapore.
